<p>This module is an extended search version that allows you to select a specific category for searching within its
    content. You can also change the category after defining the query. It also provides a possibility to set the
    additional product information display (description/price/manufacturer, etc.), and define the search results
    container layout, e.g., you can divide the results into a few sections with the controls (pagination,
    next/previous/show all). All the module settings are available in main admin panel.</p>
